## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
This proposal allocates 1% of the Yearn Rewards to funding public goods.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the YIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the YIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
This proposal allocates 1% of the Yearn Rewards to funding public goods, via Gitcoin Grants.  If the YIP passes, a smart contract change will be deployed that redirects 1% of the funding to a Gitcoin Grants Tech Grants Matching Pool at 0x232C95A72F132392171831cEcEc8c1161975c398.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the YIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the YIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the YIP will address the issue!-->
[This proposal has the support of a majority of yearn governance participants](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1298621742240403456).
[This proposal was motivated by a tweet from Nick Dodson](https://twitter.com/iamnickdodson/status/1294264371489767424?s=21 ).  

There are many promising projects in the community that support public goods (like ETH1/ETH2 development, L2 research, media, education, etc).  Given Gitcoin's long history of successfully supporting public goods on Ethereum at scale, without being captured, through a tough bear market, I believe Gitcoin is the strongest contender at the current moment, in this category.

There are two main reasons that I believe this is a good idea for the YFI community:
1. **High ROI Community Goodwill & Publicity**.  We can shift the narrative around yield farming being a "degen" thing to do to having some "regen" effects to the ecosystem, like funding the base layer upon which it depends.  This will make YFI part of the broader conversation around [rainbow colored money](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/rainbow-colored-money-the-story-behind) in the Ethereum ecosystem, and public goods funding in the information age.
2. **Funding infrastructure is a rational economic action!**  By supporting public goods, we minimize the risk of a catastrophic failure in DEFI infrastructure that destroys the foundation upon which $YFI is built. [link](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1298964731672301568)


## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the YIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
TODO 

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
TODO 

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces yEarn Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
TODO 

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for YIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
TODO
